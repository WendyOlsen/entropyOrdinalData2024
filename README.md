# entropyOrdinalData2024
As you may know, informativeness of data rests upon 'low entropy'.  Here, the entropy of an ordinal variable is handled both through logical and philosophical statements, and two competing encodings. We test for the **impact of the cumulative encoding** on entropy and regressions.  Results were presented at Royal Statistical Society 2024 and British Society for Population Studies, 2024. We supply open-source code, which can be cited and is subject to change.

SUMMARY OF THE CONTENTS * * * * * Title: Entropy of Ordinal Inputs in A Social Data Science Context: Ontic and Statistical Options By Wendy Olsen & Ziyang Zhou
We provided a rapid-fire talk at the Royal Statistical Society on 4 Sept, 2024. Then a longer talk at BSPS in Bath, UK, 11th Sept 2024. 

The files include: --Two sets of Powerpoint slides -- one code file in R script format.  Two code files in Stata format.

We are ready to take your questions via email.

In all, this set of materials might take up to three hours to read through at a rapid or superficial level. 

BEGINNERS' NOTE: For those without any programming background...I am holding a separate github helps you with the Likert scale attitudes questions in India. This is the one related to our paper in "Work, Employment and Society" journal. See https://github.com/WendyOlsen/normslabourindia - Wendy Olsen

Note: USE R-STUDIO. Try running R and open the script file. It's an RMD file. You can just run each chunk with the green triangle. Update all your software. Once that's done, it will run fine.
