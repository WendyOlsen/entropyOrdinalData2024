# entropyOrdinalData2024
The entropy of an ordinal variable is handled both through logical and philosophical statements, and two competing encodings. We test for the impact of the cumulative encoding on entropy and regressions.  Results were presented at Royal Statistical Society 2024 and British Society for Population Studies, 2024. Open source code, subject to change.
