#From this point, the verb discretize has a conflict between arulesCBA and entropy package.  However, we can use discretizeDF.supervised from arulesCBA without a conflict.

#*note, you must run the Asian barometers v7 entropy tests RMD programme first.

#tmp <- tempfile(fileext = ".dta")
#write_dta(df, tmp)
#write_dta("q63age", q63age) #path comes first.  Then the object which is source.
#none of the above works , due to non comparability of labels in the vectors. 
#write_dta(df, "/data/tmp")
#That has worked.  The file tmp.dta has appeared in the right place.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
